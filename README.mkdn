# DESCRIPTION

This is simple an element of refactoring in my `dep_changes` script.

It is admittedly not very useful in its current incarnation due to needing quite a few instances
to get anything done with them, but that's mostly due to design headaches about thinking of _any_ way to solve a few problems.

# METHODS

## `has_changes`

Returns true/false indicating whether or not `relevant` changes were found between
the two given `_prereqs` properties.

## `changes`

Returns a list of change entries:

    Added / Removed

        Module::Name      # For unversioned module additions/removals
        Module::Name 0.30 # For versioned

    Changed / Upgrade / Downgrade

        Module::Name <OLDREQ> → <NEWREQ>

# ATTRIBUTES

## `change_type`

**REQUIRED:**
One of the following indicating the type of change this group represents.

    Added     : Dependencies are new to this phase

    Upgrade   : A newer version of this dependency is required.
    Downgrade : The requirement of this dependency is no longer so stringent.
    Removed   : A dependency previously in this phase was removed.

## `phase`

**LIKELY REQUIRED**:
`HashRef`,`CPAN::Meta` or `CPAN::Meta::Prereqs` structure for _'new'_ dependencies.

## `old_prereqs`

`HashRef`,`CPAN::Meta` or `CPAN::Meta::Prereqs` structure for _'new'_ dependencies.

## `arrow_join`

The delimiter to separate change family entries.

    q[ → ]

## `name_split`
