CPAN::Changes::Group::Dependencies::Details

This is simple an element of refactoring in my "dep_changes" script.

It is admittedly not very useful in its current incarnation due to
needing quite a few instances to get anything done with them, but that's
mostly due to design headaches about thinking of *any* way to solve a
few problems.
