DESCRIPTION
    This is simple an element of refactoring in my "dep_changes" script.

    It is admittedly not very useful in its current incarnation due to
    needing quite a few instances to get anything done with them, but that's
    mostly due to design headaches about thinking of *any* way to solve a
    few problems.

METHODS
  "has_changes"
    Returns true/false indicating whether or not "relevant" changes were
    found between the two given "_prereqs" properties.

  "changes"
    Returns a list of change entries:

      Added / Removed

          Module::Name      # For unversioned module additions/removals
          Module::Name 0.30 # For versioned

      Changed / Upgrade / Downgrade

          Module::Name <OLDREQ> → <NEWREQ>
