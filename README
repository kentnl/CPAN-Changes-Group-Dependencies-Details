DESCRIPTION
    This is simple an element of refactoring in my "dep_changes" script.

    It is admittedly not very useful in its current incarnation due to
    needing quite a few instances to get anything done with them, but that's
    mostly due to design headaches about thinking of *any* way to solve a
    few problems.
